summary:
for the zoo assignment, most of things were easy as i had learned them in grade 10 or cyberpatriot. so i started with making groups, i didnt know how so i just searched it up,
after that i had to make the users and assign them into the right groups, i just used the command in the pdf, the file making was kind of annonying and longs,
so i tried making the first folder and the working my way down instead of creating the folder and file after, that part i remembered from last year with touch and mkdir,but the worst thing that i did was make the /zoo folder in my home directory instead of the root directory,
that took some time but i managed to make it work by using the mv command,( which i also used to rename misspelled files).
making the permissions was quite challenging because i just didnt understand, then Nevada explained it to me so i understood, i just needed to use chown to change the owner of the files to root which was easy by using -R, then i had to use chgrp to change the group of the file into the right groups, that part was simple when i understood it and  
then i checked everything and that was that
