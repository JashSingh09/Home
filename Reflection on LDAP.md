 

i think that [[LDAP]] was a pretty linear setup, i just had to go through every step and download things, configure with the right words, then got to the next thing,



i think that we use [[LDAP]] because its free,  and there is lots of info on how to set it up,

after i got he first user setup it was kind of a rinse and repeat system, you just need to change the info a little and you are good to go, you don't need to install anything, 
so i used a script that makes the users with the csv file that was provided, i think  that when i made the user, it worked the first time so it didn't seem too hard because normally I[[LDAP]] get things on the first try but when i actually had everything setup  




## pros
easier to scale up to setup multiple users on the server(automate) instead of having local users
because of central storage,


## Cons
big learning curve, kind of complex, because its not like other things we have done, but we can watch/read tutorials
