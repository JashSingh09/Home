		what commands do
1.ifconfig
	the command is mostly not on powershell because you need to download net-tools
uses: to get network interface information
2.ip
	you can use "ip a" or "ip addr"
uses; same as ifconfig
3.traceroute
	you can use it to follow the ip addresses and the time it, used withh the connand then a website address, traceart is for windows systems
uses: follow the path that the command takes
4.tracepath
	first you have to do "sudo apt-get install inetutils-traceroute" after do the same as the traceroute command
uses: the same as traceroute but has the round trip information, it aslo hops to the destination
5.ping
	do ping "website.com"
uses: meassure the time that it takes for a round trip of a message,it sends ICMP(Imternet Control Message Protocol)
6.netstat
	do netstat -tuln( to display listening ports),netstat -an(to display all sockets),netstat -s(to display statistics for each protocol
7.ss
	same as netstat but just explained differently
uses: a little simpler, easier to get info that you want
8.dig
	powerful tools for querying the DNS( Domain system name)
uses: dig "website.com, you can also add @dns-sever-ip for a specific server,or NX for mail servers, and do dig -x 8.8.8.8 for a reverse DNS lookup

9.nslookup
	its for finding out the domain name,mostly used to troubleshoot and dig is mostly used amd more flexible
uses: nslookup "example.com",nslookup "example".com dns-server-ip, and nslookup 8.8.8.8 for reverse lookup
10.route
	it is used to display and manipulate and display routing tables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uses:route -n shows routing table,sudo route add -net destination-network netmask netmask-address gateway-ip shows"adds routing table

host: The host command is used for DNS lookups. It can be used to find the IP address associated with a domain name or vice versa.


host example.com
arp: The arp command is used to display and manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. It shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.


arp -a
iwconfig: The iwconfig command is used to configure and display information about wireless network interfaces. It provides details such as signal strength, encryption, and mode.


iwconfig
hostname: The hostname command is used to display or set the hostname of a system. It can be helpful for identifying the system in a network.


hostname
curl or wget: Both curl and wget are used for downloading files from the internet. They support various protocols, and you can use them to retrieve content from web servers.


curl https://example.com/file.txt

wget https://example.com/file.txt
mtr: The mtr command (My Traceroute) is a network diagnostic tool that combines the functionality of ping and traceroute. It continuously traces the route to a destination and provides statistics on packet loss and latency.


mtr example.com
whois: The whois command is used to query the WHOIS database, providing information about domain registrations, owners, and other details.


whois example.com
ifplugstatus: The ifplugstatus command checks the status of a network interface's link and prints whether a cable is plugged in or not.


ifplugstatus eth0
iftop: The iftop command is a real-time console-based network bandwidth monitoring tool. It shows a list of network connections and their corresponding data rates.


iftop
tcpdump: The tcpdump command is a packet analyzer that allows the user to display, capture, and analyze TCP, UDP, and other packets on a network.


sudo tcpdump -i eth0
These commands are valuable for network troubleshooting, diagnostics, and general information retrieval in a Linux environment.

IP address (IPv4):

It's like a unique number for your computer on a network, written as sets of numbers (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

Subnet Masks:
A tool that helps computers understand which part of an IP address is for the network and which is for the specific device.

Gateway:
Think of it as the traffic cop between your home network and the internet, helping data travel back and forth.

DNS (Domain Name System):
It's like a phone book for the internet, translating easy-to-remember names (like www.example.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses.

Network Switch:
A smart traffic director for devices within your home or office, making sure data gets to the right place efficiently.

Network Router:
Connects different networks (like your home network and the internet), directing data between them.

Access Points:
Devices that make it possible for your phone or laptop to connect to the internet wirelessly, like Wi-Fi hubs.

MAC address:
A unique ID for each device's internet connection, like a fingerprint for your computer or phone.

Ports in Network Addressing:
Doorways on your computer that different services use to communicate with the outside world, each labeled with a specific number.

Types of Networks:
WAN (Wide Area Network): Big networks covering large areas.
LAN (Local Area Network): Small networks, like in your home or office.
PAN (Personal Area Network): Personal device connections, like Bluetooth.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): City-wide networks.
VPN (Virtual Private Network): Secure internet connections, useful for working remotely.
